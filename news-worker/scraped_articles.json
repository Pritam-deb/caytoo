Lord Coaker confirmed:\u201cWe have been engaging widely to consider how best to deliver these aims.\u201dThe Cadet Expansion Programme (CEP), a joint initiative between the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Education, has already yielded significant results.\u201cThe CEP has already seen a significant rise in the number of state schools with Combined Cadet Forces and we continue to invest in this growth,\u201dCoaker said.ShareFacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsAppEmailCraig LangfordCraig initially trained as a mechanical engineer, but after a brief and disillusioning stint designing ventilation systems, he pivoted to journalism.RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORLandUK backs troop mobility push to support EstoniaLandUK-EU defence pact won\u2019t give ECJ new powers, says MODLandUK unveils \u00a31bn Digital Targeting Web and new cyber commandLandUK Armed Forces gain recruits but shrink overall in 2025LandBritain\u2019s new defence pact with the EULandRegiments told off for political posts critical of LabourLandCapita awarded \u00a37.5m to deliver Army adventure trainingLandMoD issues pipeline notice for mounted SHORAD studyLandMOD outlines steps to tackle abuse in Armed ForcesLandTrump: Putin \u2018gone crazy\u2019 after record Ukraine drone attack17 COMMENTSJackoMay 29, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t                        At\t\t\t\t\t\t                        18:32Can only be a good move\ud83d\udc4dReplyDPMay 29, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t                        At\t\t\t\t\t\t                        19:02Very positive move.

A UN led convention to prevent child soldiers. Which as signatories we do not deploy under 18 to conflict areas. Although using an exemption clause we did to Iraq and Afghanistan.Also we do not teach military skills to under 16. Visits to primary schools are all but impossible by the UK military. Aspects like the bands and medical staff or okay. So music and first aid. At no point is any attempt to recruit be it direct or subliminal. Indeed most units only approach secondary schools if invited. Then only speaking directly to over fourteen.For the CCF it leaves a lot of individual skills all useful in military life but also to wider society. Plus those involved develop quicker and have wider skill sets than their peers.ReplyPaul.PMay 29, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t                        At\t\t\t\t\t\t                        22:51Excellent move: with the new \u2018Home Guard\u2019 and hopefully the return of the Sure Start program these are the schemes we need to rebuild the nation from the bottom up.ReplyBarry LarkingMay 30, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t                        At\t\t\t\t\t\t                        00:38A good move in so many ways.

You can have all the good ideas you want but to make them work they have to be funded. The current CCF are underfunded. Many with poor or dilapidated buildings. Plus you need staff to volunteer. I say a call out a few weeks ago for staff in Yarmouth. Traditional garrison areas and their environs have no problem however elsewhere it\u2019s more patchy.ReplySupportive BlokeMay 30, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t                        At\t\t\t\t\t\t                        08:44The issue always was having someone who was properly ex service who commanded respect.The head of our CCF was a total joke who\u2019d never done any proper military service. There were two teachers one ex navy officer and the other ex RAF who commanded tremendous respect but didn\u2019t want to be involved because of the clown.A lot of state schools will struggle as they have very left wing leadership.

Perhaps making it a T-Level?Would encourage wider participation and ensure such service had higher regard by the public than being a glorified scouts.

Petrol forecourt and convenience store sales were also up after fuel prices sharpened.Afterditching a price-matching schemewith Aldi and Lidl this year, the group plans to return to offering everyday low prices under the banner Asda Price by the end of next year rather than a plethora of cut-price offers.\u201cThe plan is, towards the end of the year, to return to top-line growth and get more units in people\u2019s baskets, up the price gap [with rivals] and improve availability,\u201d Leighton said.The former Co-op Group and Royal Mail boss said Asda was now between 3% and 5% cheaper than its mainstream rivals on average, although still dearer than the fast-growing Aldi and Lidl.His pledge toinvest in cutting priceswiped \u00a34bn off the value of its main listed rivals in March. He said on Thursday that the group had already reduced the price of 10,000 products and was \u201cinflating behind the rest of the market by about 2%\u201d.However, Asda has been losing share to both its bigger traditional rivals \u2013 Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 and the discounters, which are rapidly opening stores and gaining new shoppers searching for bargains amid on-going pressure on household bills.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The German-owned retailer expects to open a similar number in each of the next two years.Giles Hurley, the boss of Aldi in the UK, said the business was committed to remaining the cheapest whatever its rivals did. \u201cThe price gap with the competition is as big as ever,\u201d he said.Leighton said Asda could fight back as it was a \u201cvery different proposition\u201d to both the discounters and mainstream supermarkets \u2013 with George clothing a key part of the plan.\u201cGeorge is going to be the number one brand by volume in clothing in the next three years,\u201d he said.Leighton has said it could take five years toturn around the supermarket group, which is now controlled by TDR after itbought out Zuber Issalast year, while his brother, Mohsin, stepped back from effectively running the retailer but retains a 22.5% stake.Explore more on these topicsAsdaSupermarketsRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It currently has more than 1,000 restaurants across the UK and Ireland, the majority of which are operated by franchisees.The fast-food chain said the 7,000 new jobs it expects to create in the UK and Ireland will include servers, kitchen-based roles and managers.It will invest in its supply chain to \"strengthen long-standing relationships\" such as with Pilgrim's Europe, which is based in Warwick, and McCormick in Buckinghamshire which makes the fast-food firm's gravy, the company added.KFC is by far the largest fried chicken chain in Britain. But in recent years, smaller competitors have been growing including America's Wingstop which, in December last year, sold its UK arm to US private equity firm Sixth Street for \u00a3400m.Wingstop currently has around 57 franchised sites in the UK and plans to open another 20.Meanwhile, Popeyes UK has 65 restaurants across the UK and Ireland after a big expansion last year when it opened 33 shops.According to market research firm Kantar, Britons spent about \u00a32.4bn on fried chicken from fast food shops in the year to 20 April.Dave's Hot Chicken - the US brand which counts rapper Drake and actor Samuel L Jackson among its backers - opened its first restaurant in Britain last year, located in London, and plans to launch a further 60 shops in the UK and Ireland.Fast-food giant KFC leaves Kentucky home for TexasPublished19 FebruaryA third of KFC hires will be disadvantaged youthPublished14 November 2022'Challenging'Commenting on plans to recruit thousands of workers over the next five years, Rob Swain, general manager of KFC UK & Ireland, said he did not anticipate any difficulty in finding staff.Fast food restaurants are popular places for younger people to get entry level jobs.However, the number of 16 to 24 year-olds not in education, employment or training - commonly referred to as NEETs - totalled 923,000 between January and March,according to data from the Office for National Statistics,external.While the number is dropping, the percentage of NEETs in this age range remains comparatively high.But Mr Swain said KFC receives around half a million job applications every year, and promotes some 2,000 staff internally into management roles annually.He admitted that a recent rise in UK employment costs had been \"challenging\".In April, these grew after theNational Minimum Wagefor workers aged between 16 and 20 years-old and the National Living Wage paid to over-21 all increased.At the same time, the level of National Insurance Contributions paid by employers also rose.Mr Swain said KFC had \"talked about this a lot internally\". He said that the company's labour costs have been rising every year for a long period of time \"whether that's National Insurance, whether that's National Minimum Wage\".But he said: \"What I would say is this increase was bigger than we were expecting.\"Related topicsCompaniesRetailingKFC"

The fast food chain, which currently employs around 30,000 people, aims to create an additional 7,000 jobs as part of this expansion.Alongside new openings, KFC will upgrade 200 existing restaurants with refreshed designs and enhanced digital capabilities, reflecting the changing expectations of consumers regarding in-store experiences and mobile ordering.The move is part of a broader growth strategy amid rising demand for fast food, with the UK fried chicken market now estimated to be worth \u00a33.1 billion.

    "content": "UK data centre expansion sparks net zero concernsPosted byGeorgia Sweeting|May 27, 2025|INFRASTRUCTURE,AI,Data Centres,News,UK,Feature WeekNewsA government backed push to expand the UK\u2019s digital infrastructure is attracting criticism from environmental groups, following approval of a \u00a310 billion data centre complex in Northumberland,The TelegraphhasreportedThe \u00a310 billion development announced last September, will see ten data centres built across a 133-acre site. Backed by US investment giant Blackstone and led by infrastructure firm QTS, the site is expected to emit around 184,000 tonnes of CO2 per year \u2013 a total higher than that produced by Birmingham Airport.Planning documents show the facility will double industrial emissions in Northumberland and contribute 12% of the county\u2019s total emissions by 2030.The project is part of a broader government strategy to accelerate digital growth and support AI. Since September 2023, data centres have been classified as critical national infrastructure, with the government working to develop an \u201cAI growth zones\u201d strategy to encourage more deployments and eliminate restrictions.Earlier this year, aCiena surveyof global data centre leaders found that bandwidth demand is expected to grow sixfold over the next five years, largely driven by AI-related computing. While these facilities are becoming essential for digital infrastructure, their growing energy demands have sparked concerns about long-term sustainability and power consumption.Campaigners say the government\u2019s approach could come at a serious environmental cost. The UK islegally bound to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and critics argue projects of this scale risk derailing local and national targets.\u201cIt is difficult to see how the Government plans to reach its manifesto commitment of hitting net zero by 2050 when it is approving construction projects that add the impact of a major regional airport to our annual emissions,\u201d said Martha Dark, of the non-profit group Foxglove.Data centres consume huge amounts of electricity to power and cool thousands of servers. While renewable energy is the cleanest option, it\u2019s not always reliable or available when needed.Sources such as wind and solar cannot produce power all the time, and the UK\u2019s energy grid is not yet set up to store or deliver enough renewable power around the clock. Until that changes, there\u2019s a risk that big developments like the Blyth site will still rely partly on fossil fuels, making it harder to cut emissions overall. Microsoft and Google, both of whom are investing heavily in data centres globally, reported higher carbon emissions in their latest annual reports, despite clean energy commitments.A Government spokesperson defended the decision, saying \u201cOur Clean Power Action Plan \u00a0(the UK government\u2019s strategy to achieve a mostly fossil fuel-free electricity system by 2030) will enable the development of new energy intensive industries such as data centres, helping to grow the economy.\u201cAdvanced modular reactors will play a particularly important role in growing energy-hungry sectors like AI and we\u2019re shaking up the planning rules to make it easier to build nuclear power stations across the country.\u201dJoin us at Connected Britain, 24-25 September in London.

It comes as emerging competitors pose a threat to the chain\u2019s dominance.Chicken shop franchise KFC is planning to expand significantly across the UK and Ireland in the next five years, the company has announced.It says it will create 7,000 new jobs and invest \u00a31.5 billion. KFC will be building new restaurants in \u2018key locations\u2019 that include Ireland and northern England.As the BBC reports, the fried chicken business is huge in the UK, with consumers spending billions each year. According to Kantar data, the British public spent \u00a32.8 billion on fried chicken from April 2023 to early 2024.\u00a3500 million will be poured into 500 new franchise buildings. KFC will also be upgrading its existing restaurants, most of which operate as independent franchises. That\u2019s a sizeable investment considering KFC has over 1,000 sites in the UK.New jobs will include servers, kitchen-based roles and managers.KFC is the largest fried chicken chain in Britain by quite some margin. It has been a staple of drunken nights out, lazy evening meals or a quick chicken fix for decades, though its lead is under threat with the emergence of more competitor chains.These include brands like Wingstop and Popeyes, both of which have begun expansion across the UK in the past few years. While they\u2019ve nowhere near the same amount of brick-and-mortar restaurants in Britain as KFC, both are planning to open new stores in the coming years.Wingstop has roughly 57 sites currently, with another 20 planned to open in the future. Popeyes UK has 65 eateries and opened 33 more last year.The rise of Uber Eats and similar delivery apps over the last decade has also opened up the competition and provided greater room for diversity, thanks to the added convenience and easier access to other options. Overall, the UK food deliver marketreached an estimated \u00a33.8 billion in valuein 2024 alone.Related articlesCredit: ThredThe Common ThredByJessica ByrneLondon, UKon the \u2018small plates\u2019 scam + learning not to be a haterCredit: UnsplashCompaniesByCharlie CoombsBristol, UKEU plans extra fee on small parcels often sent from ChinaThe new jobs for UK citizens provided by KFC\u2019s plans will certainly be welcome news, given thecurrent, difficult job market.

    "content": "UK\u2019s Ambitious Plans to Attract Global Talent28.05.2025The UK government has recently unveiled a white paper titledRestoring Control over the Immigration System, outlining an ambitious strategy to bolster the country\u2019s reputation as a magnet for the world\u2019s most highly skilled individuals.In a fiercely competitive global landscape, nations are vying to attract top talent that can drive innovation, economic growth, and global influence. The UK\u2019s plans aim to position itself prominently among these contenders, but questions remain: Will these initiatives truly succeed in drawing the brightest minds, or will challenges such as visa costs and bureaucratic hurdles cause talented individuals to look elsewhere?The Vision: A Talent-Driven FutureAt the heart of the UK\u2019s strategy is a commitment to expand pathways for highly skilled professionals\u2014scientists, entrepreneurs, researchers, and innovators\u2014to come to the UK. The government emphasises several key measures:Increasing High-Talent Routes:The plan is to boost the number of arrivals via targeted routes like theGlobal Talent visa,High Potential Individual (HPI), andInnovator Founderschemes. These routes are designed to attract individuals with exceptional skills and potential to contribute to strategic industries.Accelerating Access for Research and Innovation:The UK aims to streamline access for research interns, especially in cutting-edge fields like Artificial Intelligence, facilitating connections between businesses and promising young talent worldwide.Simplifying the Visa Process:Making it more straightforward for top scientific and design talent to secure visas could reduce bureaucratic barriers that often deter applicants.Supporting Entrepreneurship:The government intends to review and possibly expand the Innovator Founder visa, making it easier for talented students studying in UK universities to launch their businesses in the UK.Expanding Business Mobility:Doubling the number of workers that overseas businesses can send to establish a UK presence underscores a desire to attract international corporate investment. The existingUK Expansion Workerroute currently allows a team of employees to come to the UK to undertake the set-up phase (up to a maximum of 5 workers at any one time).Enhancing the High Potential Individual Route:The plan includes expanding the list of qualifying institutions and maintaining safeguards to ensure the route benefits the UK workforce.The Challenges: Cost, Perception, and CompetitionWhile these initiatives are promising, several obstacles threaten to undermine their effectiveness:Visa Costs and Processing Times:The financial and administrative burden of obtaining visas remains a significant barrier. High costs and prolonged processing times can discourage talented individuals from choosing the UK, especially when more streamlined options exist elsewhere.Inward Focus and Immigration Scepticism:A shift toward inward-looking policies and increased migration controls may send mixed signals to potential applicants, who might perceive the UK as less welcoming or unstable compared to other countries with more attractive immigration regimes.Global Competition:Countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and certain European nations are actively refining their immigration policies to attract global talent. They often offer more generous pathways, lower costs, and clearer incentives, making them more appealing destinations.Post-Brexit Uncertainty:The UK\u2019s departure from the European Union has introduced a level of uncertainty around mobility and regional cooperation, potentially making it less attractive relative to the ease of movement within the EU or to other global hubs.Will the UK Succeed?The UK\u2019s strategic focus on high-skilled migration is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. If implemented effectively, these measures could enhance the country\u2019s global standing as a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship. However, the success of this vision hinges on several critical factors:Cost and Accessibility:Reducing visa costs and simplifying procedures are essential to making the UK an attractive option for talent worldwide.Perception and Messaging:The government must communicate a welcoming stance that balances control with openness, dispelling fears of overly restrictive policies.Competitive Policy Frameworks:The UK needs to ensure its offerings are competitive\u2014not just on paper but in the practical, day-to-day experience of potential migrants.Addressing Broader Factors:Infrastructure, quality of life, research funding, and career opportunities will also influence decisions beyond just immigration policies.The UK\u2019s plans to attract global talent demonstrate a clear recognition of the importance of highly skilled individuals in shaping economic future. Yet, in a fiercely competitive global arena, policy initiatives alone may not suffice. The country must address practical barriers, project a welcoming image, and remain adaptable in an ever-changing international landscape. Only then can it hope to turn these ambitious plans into tangible success stories\u2014luring the world\u2019s brightest minds and ensuring the UK remains at the forefront of innovation and growth.Smith Stone Walters will continue to monitor changes to the immigration system and provide updates when more information is available.

    "content": "BioNTech announced that its subsidiary BioNTech UK Ltd. signed a grant agreement with the UK Government to broaden the company\u2019s R&D activities for innovative medicines in the UK. And as part of the agreement, BioNTech is committed to investing up to \u00a31 billion over the next 10 years.The company\u2019s efforts will be supported by a grant of up to \u00a3129 million for a period of 10 years from the UK Government. This grant marks one of the largest in UK history for a pharmaceutical company. This grant is part of the UK government\u2019s mission to enhance its life sciences sector and support innovative companies, with the aim of unlocking progress in medical science.This grant agreement builds on a multi-year collaboration with the UK government announced in January 2023. This deal is focused on three pillars:1.) Accelerating clinical trials for product candidates of BioNTech\u2019s oncology pipeline2.) Investments into expanding BioNTech\u2019s R&D footprint in the UK as one of the Company\u2019s key markets, and3.) Research into certain areas including structural biology, regenerative medicine, and infectious disease vaccines.BioNTech plans on using the grant to support its establishment of two new R&D centers, the first of which will be based in Cambridge and a second of which is currently being planned.The Cambridge R&D center will be focused on genomics, oncology, structural biology, and regenerative medicine, with capacity for more than 90 highly skilled scientists, including BioNTech\u2019s existing scientists and researchers working in the UK. And BioNTech will strengthen its footprint by establishing its UK headquarters in London, which will bring together the Company\u2019s London-based teams and create new jobs in global and regional supporting functions in the UK over the next 10 years.BioNTech\u2019s London office will also accommodate the company\u2019s AI hub led by its wholly owned subsidiary InstaDeep, a leading global technology company in the field of AI and machine learning. BioNTech\u2019s AI Hub plays a vital role in the Company\u2019s research capabilities helping to advance AI-powered medical research.These efforts are part of BioNTech\u2019s strategy to advance research and development of innovative cancer immunotherapies aimed at bringing multiple cancer treatments to the market by 2030, if successfully developed and approved. And as of today, several hundred patients have gained access to investigational mRNA-based cancer immunotherapies in the UK through the collaboration as part of BioNTech\u2019s global clinical trial programs."

    "content": "KFC announces \u00a31.5bn UK investment to upgrade restaurants and create 7,000 jobs27 May 2025In BusinessJamie YoungKFC has unveiled a \u00a31.49 billion investment plan for the UK and Ireland, marking one of its most ambitious expansions since entering the British market nearly 60 years ago.The global fried chicken giant said the investment, which will be rolled out over the next five years, is expected to create more than 7,000 new jobs and deliver a \u00a3169 million boost to the UK economy.The fast-food brand, formerly known as Kentucky Fried Chicken, plans to use the investment to upgrade hundreds of restaurants and expand its footprint with up to 500 new outlets, including a focus on drive-throughs and strategic growth regions such as Ireland and the northwest of England.\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen such strong demand for freshly prepared fried chicken as we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d said Rob Swain, general manager of KFC UK and Ireland. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re doubling down on our commitment to the UK and Ireland with a major investment in our restaurants and in the suppliers who have been so crucial to our success.\u201dAround \u00a3466 million of the investment will go toward building new sites, while another 20 per cent of KFC\u2019s current estate \u2014 more than 200 restaurants \u2014 will be refurbished, bringing updated designs, improved facilities, and a better customer experience to its core locations.The expansion comes as theUK\u2019s fried chicken market continues to boom, now estimated to be worth \u00a33.1 billion. The sector has become increasingly competitive with the arrival of cult US brands like Popeyes, Wingstop, Dave\u2019s Hot Chicken, and Slim Chickens, all seeking to capture a slice of the growing appetite for fried chicken among British consumers.Despite the intensifying competition, Swain says KFC remains in a strong leadership position and is well placed to unlock further growth.KFC\u2019s growth will also deliver a major jobs boost, creating kitchen and management roles within its own 270 company-owned restaurants and across its network of 27 UK franchise partners, which collectively employ more than 30,000 people.Founded in the 1950s by Colonel Harland Sanders, KFC opened its first UK restaurant in Preston in 1965, becoming a staple of British high streets and town centres. The company\u2019s iconic slogan \u2014 \u201cFinger lickin\u2019 good\u201d \u2014 has become part of global pop culture, evolving over the years to reflect changing customer tastes and trends.The investment was welcomed by the wider hospitality industry. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said the announcement was a vote of confidence in the sector\u2019s ability to drive regional growth and create local employment.\u201cHospitality\u2019s ability tocreate places where people want to live, work and investis unrivalled,\u201d she said. \u201cThis significant announcement from KFC is proof of that and will help to drive socially productive growth, deliver economically and support employment across the UK.\u201dAs the brand celebrates its 60th anniversary in the UK, KFC\u2019s major reinvestment signals a long-term commitment not just to feeding demand, but to supporting communities, suppliers and the broader UK economy well into the next decade.Jamie YoungJamie is Senior Reporter at Business Matters, bringing over a decade of experience in UK SME business reporting. \r\nJamie holds a degree in Business Administration and regularly participates in industry conferences and workshops.\r\n\r\nWhen not reporting on the latest business developments, Jamie is passionate about mentoring up-and-coming journalists and entrepreneurs to inspire the next generation of business leaders.View all postsSharingFacebookTwitterLinkedInPinterestEmail"

    "content": "InDomestic AffairsNewcastle Joins easyJet\u2019s UK Expansion as Budget Travel Demand Soars26th May 2025Valuable InsightsPin IteasyJet has confirmed plans to establish a new operational base at Newcastle International Airport by March 2026, marking its 11th UK base. Three Airbus A320neo aircraft will be stationed at the site, creating 130 direct jobs for pilots, cabin crew, and engineers while sustaining approximately 1,200 regional jobs. The move underscores the airline\u2019s aggressive expansion strategy outside London, targeting underserved markets in northern England and southern Scotland.easyJet UKoperates 190 Airbus aircraft (47 A319s, 82 A320s, 50 A320neos, and 11 A321neos), while the broader group\u2019s fleet totals 356 planes. The airline serves over 130 European airports across 31 countries, with 456 new aircraft on order (190 A320neos and 266 A321neos) to meet projected demand.The Newcastle base will enable easyJet to broaden its route network from the airport, which currently serves eight destinations including Alicante, Amsterdam, and Malaga. Additional summer holiday routes are expected to be announced in coming weeks. The carrier emphasised its focus on capturing the UK\u2019s growing leisure travel market, where demand has surged post-pandemic. Kenton Jarvis, easyJet\u2019s UK CEO, framed the expansion as a strategic play to reinforce the airline\u2019s dominance in short-haul leisure travel while driving regional economic growth. He noted that British consumers now prioritise holidays more than ever, with easyJet Holidays capitalising on this trend through competitive pricing and an expanded route portfolio.Newcastle Airport\u2019s Chief Executive, Nick Jones, hailed the decision as a major economic win for the Northeast, citing the airport\u2019s existing \u00a31 billion annual gross value added (GVA) contribution. The new base is projected to further boost tourism and job creation, offering hundreds of thousands of additional low-cost seats and holiday packages.This follows easyJet\u2019s recent UK expansions, including new bases at London Southend and Birmingham International, alongside the integration of seven additional A320neo aircraft into its British fleet. The airline is deploying its largest-ever UK flight schedule this summer, with 33 million seats\u2014500,000 more than 2023\u2014and 44 new routes, including three previously unserved destinations.The UK remains easyJet\u2019s largest market, accounting for 56% of its customer base. With rivals like Ryanair and Wizz Air tightening competition, the Newcastle investment signals easyJet\u2019s intent to lock in regional loyalty and offset capacity constraints at congested southern hubs. Analysts suggest the move also preempts potential airport slot shortages, as the UK\u2019s aviation sector grapples with post-Brexit operational challenges and air traffic control disruptions.While the expansion aligns with government rhetoric on \u201clevelling up\u201d regional economies, critics argue that short-haul leisure growth conflicts with the UK\u2019s net-zero targets. easyJet has countered by highlighting its fleet modernisation, with A320neos offering 15% lower emissions than older models\u2014a thinly veiled nod to regulatory pressures.The announcement comes as the Civil Aviation Authority reports a 12% year-on-year increase in UK passenger demand, with budget carriers capturing 63% of the market. For now, easyJet\u2019s gamble hinges on Britons\u2019 unrelenting appetite for affordable escapes\u2014regardless of economic headwinds.ShareNo CommentsLeave a Comment\u0394This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.Learn how your comment data is processed.Previous PostUK sees surge in\u2026InDomestic AffairsUK sees surge in American citizenship applications \u2014 but the numbers remain tinyView PostNext PostStrategic Debt Play: UK Launches\u2026InMoney MattersStrategic Debt Play: UK Launches 4% 2063 Gilt Auction to Lock in Long-Term FinancingView Post"

This report will guide executive decision-making in an increasingly complex digital environment by covering digitalization trends, market opportunities with real-world case examples, the cybersecurity landscape, recent market dynamics, competitive pressures, and regulatory changes from 2024 to 2025.Introduction & Digitalization TrendsThe United Kingdom is undergoing a significant digital transformation as businesses and public services rapidly adopt cloud computing, IoT, and AI-driven technologies. This surge in digital adoption has created new opportunities and heightened risks, making robust application security a top priority for organizations. Digitalization trends in 2024-2025 underscore a drive toward integrated digital services, with secure software development becoming essential for protecting sensitive information.Recent initiatives by both government and industry are accelerating the shift toward digital-first strategies. From the rollout of smart cities to the digital transformation of financial services, every sector invests in technology that demands enhanced cybersecurity measures. This evolving landscape pushes organizations to rethink their security architectures and embrace innovative, proactive approaches.Market OpportunityThe growing digital ecosystem in the United Kingdom presents significant opportunities for advanced application security solutions. Organizations recognize that integrating security early in the software development lifecycle can mitigate risks and protect brand reputation. Increasingly, companies are shifting their strategies to include security as a competitive differentiator.For example, HSBC has recently revamped its digital banking platform with state-of-the-art application security measures. By implementing automated vulnerability assessments and real-time threat detection, HSBC has enhanced its defense mechanisms and strengthened customer trust. This case study demonstrates how strategic security investments can drive business continuity and offer a market edge.United Kingdom's Cybersecurity LandscapeThe UK's cybersecurity framework benefits from robust public-private partnerships and a proactive regulatory environment. Key institutions, such as the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), provide essential guidance and support, helping organizations implement best practices across various industries. Recently, initiatives have focused on improving threat intelligence sharing and incident response strategies. Between 2024 and 2025, the cybersecurity landscape in the United Kingdom evolved to address increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Collaboration among government bodies, industry stakeholders, and academia has led to the development of cutting-edge security technologies. This integrated approach reinforces the nation's commitment to maintaining a secure digital infrastructure.Despite these advances, the UK faces significant security challenges in its application security domain. Cybercriminals continue to deploy advanced techniques such as ransomware, phishing, and zero-day exploits, exposing vulnerabilities in digital systems. Legacy systems and inconsistent security practices in some sectors add to the complexity of the threat landscape. Additionally, the rapid pace of digital transformation may outstrip organizations' ability to adequately secure their applications. A cybersecurity talent shortage further exacerbates this issue, leaving some enterprises more vulnerable than others. Addressing these challenges requires continuous investment in modern security technologies and comprehensive staff training.Current Market for Application SecurityOver the past year, the UK application security market has experienced robust growth driven by increased digital transformation across finance, healthcare, and retail industries. Organizations have boosted their security budgets to deploy automated vulnerability assessments, AI-driven threat detection, and cloud-native security solutions.The increasing recognition of cyber incidents' financial and reputational costs fuels this momentum. As companies embed security deeper into their development lifecycles, they reduce risk and gain a competitive advantage. The current market trends signal a decisive shift toward proactive cybersecurity measures across the board.Competitive Landscape of the Application Security IndustryThe competitive landscape in the United Kingdom features a dynamic mix of global leaders and innovative local players. International firms like Veracode and Checkmarx are well-established, offering comprehensive security solutions tailored to diverse enterprise needs. Simultaneously, local companies such as BAE Systems' cybersecurity division and Darktrace are leveraging homegrown expertise to address regional challenges. In the past year, competition has spurred rapid innovation, with many vendors incorporating machine learning, behavioral analytics, and real-time monitoring into their platforms. This ongoing rivalry ensures that security solutions continuously evolve to counter emerging cyber threats. The result is a vibrant market where technology advancements and strategic partnerships drive overall industry excellence.Regulatory ChangesRecent regulatory updates have significantly impacted the application security landscape in the United Kingdom. In the last year, new guidelines introduced by the UK government and the European Union have mandated stricter cybersecurity protocols, especially for critical infrastructure and financial services. These regulations emphasize continuous risk assessments, rapid incident reporting, and enhanced data protection measures.Organizations must integrate comprehensive security controls into their digital frameworks to comply with these updated standards.

Central to this transformation is the rapid expansion of online pharmacies and the increasing use of revolutionary treatments such asMounjaro\u2014 a once-weekly injection now approved for weight management.As online pharmacy revenues in the UK surge \u2014 forecast to grow from $2.73 billion in 2024 to $4.24 billion by 2029, an increase of 55.56% \u2014 both the convenience and the complexities of digital healthcare are becoming increasingly evident.The Rise of Online Pharmacies: A Statistical SnapshotMarket Growth and Key DriversThe global online pharmacy market, valued at $109.74 billion in 2023, is projected to reach $286.26 billion by 2029, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.33%. In the UK, demand is accelerating due to:Widespread access to smartphones and the internetA post-pandemic shift towards convenienceIntegration of telemedicine and digital health platformsGreater emphasis on preventative care and general wellbeingThese developments are not only making healthcare more accessible but also boosting consumer interest in medications that can be prescribed, purchased, and delivered entirely online.Safeguarding Digital Health: Challenges in Regulation and Patient SafetyDespite the sector\u2019s rapid growth, significant challenges remain. Online pharmacies are more than twice as likely to fail regulatory inspections compared to traditional high-street pharmacies, raising concerns around governance, counterfeit medicines, and patient safety. In response, the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) has implemented stricter regulations to safeguard patients and ensure compliance.Mounjaro\u2019s Introduction: A New Era in Prescription TreatmentsWhat is Mounjaro?Mounjaro (tirzepatide) is a dual GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist, originally developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It is now authorised in the UK for weight management. Clinical trials have demonstrated weight loss of up to 22.5%, positioning it as a leading option among a new class of highly effective obesity treatments.Availability and Demand in the UKMounjaro is currently available:Through the NHS, as part of specialist weight management servicesVia private online pharmacies, with monthly prices ranging from \u00a399 to \u00a3215, depending on dosage and providerThe NHS plans to make Mounjaro available to 250,000 eligible patients over the next three years, focusing on individuals with severeobesityand related health conditions.Private providers such as SheMed, Asda Online Doctor, Ashcroft Pharmacy, and My London Pharmacy offer digital consultations, prescription approvals, and home delivery \u2014 removing traditional barriers to access.Price Comparison: Mounjaro (Tirzepatide) in UK Online Pharmacies (May 2025)Pharmacy2.5mg5mg7.5mg10mg12.5mg15mgSheMed\u00a399\u00a3159\u00a3159\u00a3159\u00a3159\u00a3159Nottingham Weight Loss\u00a3129\u00a3139\u00a3149\u00a3159\u00a3169\u00a3179Chemist 4 U\u00a3129\u00a3139\u00a3169\u00a3179\u00a3189\u00a3189Ashcroft Pharmacy\u00a3120\u00a3139\u00a3169\u00a3189\u00a3204\u00a3204Asda Online Doctor\u00a3128.98\u00a3139\u00a3169.99\u00a3189.99\u00a3204.95\u00a3204.95Superdrug\u00a3215\u00a3215\u00a3225\u00a3225\u00a3245\u00a3245Boots\u00a3219\u00a3219\u00a3229\u00a3229\u00a3249\u00a3249The Future of Healthcare: Where Digital Health Meets Breakthrough MedicationImproved Access and Personalised CareWith online consultations and AI-supported tools, UK patients now benefit from:Easier access to treatment in rural or underserved areasRemote monitoring and virtual pharmacist guidanceEnhanced treatment adherence through tailored plans and digital follow-upsAI and Automation in Pharmacy ServicesBritish pharmacies are increasingly adopting AI technologies for:Prescription review and triageStock management and automated refillsTimely delivery of essential medicinesWhile automation enhances efficiency, ongoing compliance with GPhC, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and the UK\u2019s data protection regulations (UK GDPR) remains vital to prevent harm and uphold public trust.Challenges Ahead: Regulation, Privacy, and TrustDespite its potential, the digital pharmacy model introduces complex challenges:Regulatory frameworks must evolve to manage cross-border sales, ethical AI use, and cybersecurity risksOnline pharmacies continue to face higher risks of non-compliance, necessitating greater oversight and professional accountabilityConclusion: Navigating a New Frontier in UK HealthcareThe convergence of digital innovation, artificial intelligence, and transformative treatments such as Mounjaro is reshaping the UK healthcare landscape. As more patients turn to telehealth and online prescriptions, the healthcare system must evolve to safeguard safety, transparency, and public trust.The future ofhealthcareis undeniably digital. But its long-term success relies on collaboration between providers, policymakers, and patients \u2014 ensuring that accessibility, safety, and responsibility remain central to this evolving landscape.SharingFacebookTwitterLinkedInPinterestEmail"

    "content": "Business newsWhat Is a Fractional CMO? Why Startups Are Hiring Fractional Marketing Managers to Lead GrowthByHassan JavedPosted onMay 27, 2025ShareShareShareShareEmailWhen most people hear \u201cCMO,\u201d they picture a Chief Marketing Officer overseeing brand strategy, managing large teams, and presenting long-term marketing roadmaps to the executive team. It\u2019s a role traditionally rooted in big-picture thinking, quarterly planning, and polished slide decks.That\u2019s great for large enterprises. But early-stage startups don\u2019t need a strategist in a corner office\u2014they need someone who canbuild a growth system from the ground up.They need someone who can:Design and execute full-funnel growth plansManage budgets across paid and organic channelsMonitor metrics like CAC, LTV, and churnLaunch scrappy experiments with a high bias toward actionIdeally, this person has operated in venture-backed environments and been through at least one acquisition or exit. They understand not just how to grow\u2014but how to scale under pressure.That\u2019s where thefractional CMOorfractional marketing managercomes in.\ud83e\udd14 What Is a Fractional CMO?Afractional CMOis a part-time or contract-based marketing leader who works with startups to guide strategy and lead execution\u2014without the cost of a full-time executive.They typically work 20 to 30 hours a week, and their impact is felt across brand, performance, lifecycle, and analytics.Since the COVID-19 pandemic, this model has grown rapidly in popularity. Founders now prioritize flexibility, speed, and cross-functional talent\u2014making thefractional CMOan ideal fit.\ud83d\udd0d Why They Don\u2019t Look Like Traditional CMOsThe typicalfractional marketing managertoday doesn\u2019t come from a Fortune 500 background. More than80%come from startups and growth-stage environments.You\u2019ll see titles like:Growth ManagerPerformance MarketerHead of MarketingThese aren\u2019t \u201cbrand-first\u201d hires. They\u2019re product-aware, data-fluent operators who build systems that move metrics. AsPostHogputs it, theythink like engineers:\u201cThe best growth leaders treat growth like a product\u2014testing, iterating, measuring, and optimizing continuously.\u201dHere\u2019s what that actually looks like across three key areas:\ud83e\uddf2 1. User Acquisition: Strategy Meets SpeedAfractional CMObuilds and runs the full acquisition engine. That includes:Budgetingacross Meta, Google Ads, Reddit, YouTube, TikTokDesigning thechannel mixbased on funnel stage, CAC, and LTVAligning acquisition with clearmarketing OKRs(e.g., MoM growth, $CAC targets)Running structured experiments: ad creatives, landing pages, and new messagingThe goal isn\u2019t just more traffic\u2014it\u2019s identifying scalable, repeatable growth channels.\ud83d\udd01 2. User Retention: Revenue Starts After Sign-UpRetention is where real growth compounds. A strongfractional marketing managergoes deep into:Pricing teststo find the optimal model for different customer segmentsChurn reductionvia onboarding improvements and lifecycle campaignsMonitoringLTV, activation rate, and retention cohortsto refine funnel stepsCollaborating with product to build features that boost engagement and upgrade rates\ud83e\udde0 3. Analytics & Automation: The Technical BackboneThis is where most traditional marketers fall short\u2014and where modernfractional CMOsstand out.They build the infrastructure needed to track performance and automate at scale:Implementing full-funnel stacks:GA4, Mixpanel, Segment, PostHog, AmplitudeDesigningclean event schemasand tracking plansSetting up real dashboards\u2014not vanity chartsAutomating lifecycle flows throughCustomer.io, HubSpot, Klaviyo, or BrazeRunningA/B tests and attribution modelsto validate growth bets quicklyYou can\u2019t optimize what you can\u2019t track. A fractional CMO makes sure you\u2019re tracking everything that matters.\ud83d\udc40 What Makes a Fractional CMO Different from a Freelancer?This is where a lot of startups get stuck.Freelancers are great for execution:\u2705 Need a Facebook ad?\u2705 A landing page?\u2705 A blog post?They\u2019ll get it done. But they won\u2019t design your growth system. They won\u2019t connect paid media to lifecycle or run channel-level CAC analysis.Fractional CMOs own the whole system.They:Set the roadmap and KPIsBuild the creative and execution planOversee channel mix and budgetLead testing, analysis, and optimizationRelying on freelancers without a growth architect is like building a house with no blueprint. You\u2019ll have materials\u2014but no structure.\ud83d\ude80 Why Founders Are Embracing the Growth Team-for-Hire ModelHiring a full-time team takes months. And even then, you might not need five full-time people\u2014yet.But you still need:A strategistA media buyerA designerA content writerA lifecycle marketerThat\u2019s why thegrowth team-for-hiremodel is gaining traction. You get:A fractional CMO to lead strategyA lightweight team to execute across channelsFast testing, faster iteration, and real tractionIt\u2019s high-impact growth\u2014without the overhead.\ud83d\udd0e Where to Hire a Fractional CMOThere are several ways to find greatfractional CMOsorfractional marketing managers:PlatformSummaryToptalPremium, highly vetted talent. Ideal for later-stage startups.UpworkFlexible and wide-ranging, but quality varies.Get-to-Rev.comPerfect for early-stage startups. Offers afractional CMOwith a built-ingrowth team for hire, covering creative, content, and strategy\u2014ideal when you don\u2019t want to hire five freelancers just to get moving.BolsterC-level executive matching. Suited for VC-backed companies.If you need execution and strategy together, skip the piecemeal route and look for integrated setups.\u270f\ufe0f Final ThoughtsStartups don\u2019t just need marketers\u2014they need builders. People who candesign systems, launch fast, and learn even faster.Afractional CMO\u2014especially one with startup experience\u2014is often the smartest move you can make between Seed and Series A.It\u2019s fast, lean, and focused on one thing: growth that compounds.Related Items:CMO,FractionalShareShareShareShareEmailRecommended for youSteve Lesnard Sits Down To Discuss The North Faces Collaborations, Vision for the Brand, and Future of AdventureArtificial Intelligence for Digital Media: Exclusive Interview with WowYow Co-Founder and CMO Jarett BoskovichCDRs Will Allow Fractional Ownership of Top Stocks Like Apple and AmazonComments"

Barry will step into the CCO role on June 2, replacing Richard Simkin, who\u2019s led Indivior\u2019s commercial organization for the last decade.Barry joins the OUD-focused pharma aftermore than eight years at Endo, a tenure that included roles as chief commercial officer of Endo's branded pharmaceuticals and, for the last five years, as president of the company's global commercial operations. Before that, he logged 24 years at Sanofi, culminating in a stint as senior commercial leader and general manager of the pharma giant's North American general medicines business unit.\u201cI am honored to join Indivior at such a pivotal time for the company,\u201d Barry said in a statement. \u201cIndivior has built a strong foundation and is well-positioned to broaden its leadership position in opioid use disorder. I look forward to working with the team to grow Sublocade and maximize the potential of the Indivior portfolio.\u201dBarry isn\u2019t the only new face in Indivior\u2019s C-suite: Earlier this year, the company announced that CEO Mark Crossleywould be stepping down\u201cby mutual agreement,\u201d to be replaced by Joe Ciaffoni, who previously held leadership roles at Biogen, Endo, Collegium Pharmaceutical and more. The transition was completed this month.Barry is taking the commercial reins as the company ramps up marketing spending to boost Sublocade sales.In its first-quarter earningsreport(PDF) last month, Indivior reported a 2% year-over-year drop in net revenues for Sublocade. The drop came as sales in the organized health system channel grew, but were \u201cmore than offset\u201d by a decline in the justice system channel \u201cdue to near-term funding gaps among certain customers.\u201dThe company has also faced competition from other opioid addiction treatments like Camurus\u2019 Brixadi\u2014a situation that, in part, led investment fund Oaktree Capital Management tocall for a management shake-upat Indivior last fall.RelatedIndivior-backed paper champions fast-acting overdose reversal meds against synthetic opioidsIndivior is planning to turn that drop around in the second half of the year, however, thanks to increased marketing investments as well as recent FDA-approved changes to Sublocade\u2019s label that expand the drug\u2019s possible injection sites and speed up the timing of its first and second doses in treating patients with OUD.In a call with investors about the first-quarter earnings, Crossley said the marketing push\u2014targeting both healthcare workers and patients\u2014is already making an impact in terms of digital impressions and brand searches.Indiviorchief commercial officerhiringexecutivesEndoSanofiMarketingConnectThe TeamAdvertiseMarketing KitLet's TalkJoin UsNewslettersResourcesRSS FeedsOur BrandsFierce BiotechFierce HealthcareFierce PharmaOur EventsLife Sciences Events\u00a92025 Questex LLC All rights reserved.Terms of usePrivacy PolicyPrivacy Settings"

Altogether, more than 50,000 apps now rely on RevenueCat to manage subscriptions, consumables, lifetime purchases, and\u2014newly\u2014virtual currencies, making it the go\u2011to platform for developers looking to monetize their product.Recent launches include Paywalls, a drag-and-drop paywall editor that lets developers build, configure, deploy, and test paywalls without touching code; Web Billing for off-app store transactions; and virtual currency support \u2014 an increasingly popular approach to monetization in AI and gaming.The company plans to expand further into fintech, solving developer cashflow constraints caused by net-45 app store payout cycles. RevenueCat also plans to roll out features that help developers acquire users, optimize conversions and boost retention \u2014 a holistic approach to running a thriving consumer app.\u201cDevelopers deserve a frictionless way to make money, and nobody has approached this with our level of focus,\u201d saidJacob Eiting, CEO and co-founder of RevenueCat. \u201cWe\u2019re already assisting more annual app revenue than existed in the entire ecosystem when we started in 2017. The market has grown 10x, and I expect another 10x over the next decade. By staying radically focused on helping developers get paid, I believe we can build a generational public company.\u201dRevenueCat believes it is well-positioned to help apps navigate changes in consumer software monetization. Given the recent ruling that developers may now use non-in-app purchases in the USA on iOS, there\u2019s an opportunity to save significant money in platform fees by sending users to a web checkout page instead.In response, RevenueCat shipped its Web Paywall Button, giving developers a drop\u2011in way to A/B\u2011test external payments versus in\u2011app purchases while easily targeting eligible users.RevenueCat said it processes\u00a0more than $8 billion in annual transactions, powering monetization for OpenAI\u2019s\u00a0ChatGPT, Notion, VSCO and Runna\u00a0(recently acquired by Strava).Sponsored Links by DQ PromoteXFacebookLinkedInPinterestRedditHackerNewsTelegramWeiboEmailPrintSubscribeLikeCopy LinkThis entry was posted inFintechand taggedbain capital,funding round,Jacob Eiting,Mark Fiorentino,RevenueCat.

Series B shrank even further from 7.4 to just 5.8 years.Related Article Block PlaceholderArticle ID: 316847Airwallex nears $10 billion valuation after historic $466 million Series F raiseDavid AdamsIt\u2019s one of the clearest signs yet that the post-2021 correction is starting to lift. From 2022 to 2024, many growth-stage companies were stuck in purgatory \u2014 pitching into cautious markets, stretching runways, and waiting for the funding window to reopen.Faster raises don\u2019t necessarily mean easier onesBut just because rounds are happening faster doesn\u2019t mean capital is flowing as freely as it once was.Investors remain cautious, and the companies progressing through B and C rounds more quickly seem to be the ones with solid traction, tight discipline, and clear market fit.In fact, Cut Through\u2019sdata from Q1 showedthe $5\u2013$20 million funding bracket (which tends to be Series A and B in Australia) recorded its lowest deal count since mid-2023. So even though timelines are compressing, many investors are still focused on doubling down on known winners.We saw this play outjust last weekwhen Blackbird and Airtreebacked Airwallex for the first time in its Series F round.Related Article Block PlaceholderArticle ID: 315099AI tops startup funding deals in Australia, but there\u2019s a catchTegan JonesThe $466 million raise brought the fintech\u2019s valuation to $9.6 billion, yet it was only at this late stage the local giants came on board. It\u2019s a clear signal that even the country\u2019s top firms are favouring de-risked bets with proven scale.So it seems the hangover from the \u201cfree money\u201d correction still lingers. While the tempo is picking up, this is more of a reset than a return to boom-era behaviour.Early-stage startup funding held steadyInterestingly, the slowdown over the past few years appears to have been mostly geared towards mid-to-late stage startups.Related Article Block PlaceholderArticle ID: 316718Seven Aussie startups that raised $495.8 million this weekEloise KeatingANDTegan Jones1The report shows seed-stage raises stayed steady through the downturn, with most startups landing them around the three-year mark consistently since 2020. In Q1 2025, that dipped slightly to 2.6 years.This points to an early-stage ecosystem that never really stalled \u2014 it just got backed up further down the line. Series A rounds are also starting to move again, with the median now under five years for the first time since 2022.If the trend holds, founders who kept building through the correction may find themselves moving faster than expected.

These professionals are available on demand and typically arrive within 10 minutes, with services billed by the hour.\u201cThe plan is to scale Snabbit to more than 200 micro-markets in the next nine to 12 months. We\u2019re now in around 10 micro-markets, so that\u2019s like a 20X multiple from here. We\u2019re also building out the team,\u201d Agarwal told ET.Live EventsSnabbit operates a full-stack model, managing the sourcing, training, and deployment of its workforce.

According to Agarwal, Snabbit has over 600 professionals on its platform, and this number is doubling every month.He added that the income potential for professionals on the platform is significantly higher than traditional offline channels, with someone working a 12-hour shift able to earn up to Rs 40,000 a month\u2014about twice as much as they might make offline.\u201cSnabbit is not a category-based service as much as it is about getting someone skilled and trained to help you out. That help could be with cleaning the home, it could be with just an ad hoc task, or it could be, like, you have guests over and you need an extra hand. So, it\u2019s almost becoming that support system for a lot of customers who, at times, urgently need someone to help them out,\u201d said Agarwal.The company also leverages advanced technologies for sourcing, training, onboarding, and managing its workforce. It has partnered with digital identity verification provider Idfy to streamline onboarding.Earlier this year, Snabbitraised $5.5 millionin a round led by Elevation Capital, with participation from Nexus Venture Partners and other angel investors. Prior to that, in 2024, Nexus had also led a $1 million round in the startup.\u201cSnabbit is transforming home services in India by bringing speed, structure, and trust to a sector that has largely operated informally until now. Aayush and the team are building a platform for urban households, a completely new category that will cater to the needs of millions,\u201d said Rahul Taneja, partner at Lightspeed.The rise of players like Snabbit comes as urban consumers increasingly expect convenience and speed in everyday services.Last month, Urban Company, a major player in the at-home services space,filed its draft red herring prospectus(DRHP) for a Rs 1,900 crore initial public offering (IPO). As part of the offer for sale (OFS), investors such as Accel, Elevation Capital, Tiger Global, and Vy Capital are looking to partially exit their stakes.Read More News onSnabbit fundingquick service appurban home servicesLightspeed investmentadvanced workforce managementhyperlocal servicesAayush AgarwalSnabbitRead More News onSnabbit fundingquick service appurban home servicesLightspeed investmentadvanced workforce managementhyperlocal servicesAayush AgarwalSnabbitPrime ExclusivesInvestment IdeasStock Report PlusePaperWealth EditionAnil Ambani is back.

    "content": "Artificial intelligence\u2022VentureAI Share Of Startup Funding Fluctuates Sharply By StageJoanna GlasnerMay 29, 2025Joanna Glasnerjglasner3SharesEmailFacebookTwitterLinkedInU.S. artificial intelligence startups are gobbling up a large share of funding at all stages. However, the biggest slice of investment is coming at late stage.That was the broad finding from a Crunchbase analysis of funding by stage to companies in AI-related industry categories. Over the past year, nearly half of venture funding went to AI-related\u00a0 enterprises, data indicates. Later stage had the largest share, with roughly 61% of venture deals related to AI.By contrast, early stage had the smallest share of AI-related financing, at 30%, followed by seed at 38%.Keep in mind: These are only stage-labeled roundsThe methodology we used comprised only early- and late-stage rounds that were labeled as a series. This included rounds from Series A and through Series J.This approach excluded many deals labeled as corporate rounds or venture rounds of undisclosed stage. For instance, the totals did not includeOpenAI\u2019s$40 billionSoftBank-backed financing announced in March.Even so, there were some pretty enormous AI-related rounds in the mix, includingDatabricks\u2019$10 billion Series Jin December,xAI\u2019s $6 billion November financing, andAnthropic\u2019s $3.5 billion March financing.What it means to skew later-stageSo how should we interpret data that shows AI scooping up its largest funding share at late stage?Typically, when we see a subsector raising more at late stage than early stage and seed, it indicates that this is a maturing space. Startup sectors such as autonomous driving, logistics and online banking, for instance, had a flurry of seed and early-stage funding a number of years ago. Now the startup pipeline skews later stage.However, this is probably not the accurate narrative for AI, given the capital intensive nature of scaling early leaders in the space. True, the GenAI platform startup pipeline is maturing, in a very cash-demanding manner. But talk to seed and early-stage investors, and they\u2019re still very much AI-focused andenthusedabout areas including agentic AI and AI-enabled healthcare.It\u2019s also possible to see AI taking a smaller share at seed and early stage as a good thing, as it may indicate companies are able to get off the ground in a reasonably cash-efficient manner. We\u2019ll see if it stays that way as they mature.Related Crunchbase queries:US AI Startup Investment By Stage, Past YearRounds Raised By Startups Using AIRelated reading:SoftBank And OpenAI Make History With Largest Startup Financing EverDatabricks Raises $10B In 2024\u2019s Largest Venture Funding DealFrom Construction To AI Diagnostics, Here Are 5 Areas Where Seed Investors Are Most ActiveIllustration:Dom GuzmanTagsAIunicornStay up to date with recent funding rounds, acquisitions, and more with the\r\n    Crunchbase Daily.You may also likeAgriculture & foodtech\u2022Artificial intelligence\u2022Health, Wellness & Biotech\u2022Startups\u2022VentureThe Week\u2019s Biggest Funding Rounds: Another Billion-Dollar AI Raise Leads List That Includes Lots Of Biotech And More AIJoanna GlasnerMay 30, 2025This week ended up as a pretty active one for large startup financings.

They see Volteras as a vital part of their transition to electric vehicles.David Klein, Head of WEX Venture Capital, said: \"WEX serves over 19 million vehicles across our fleet customers, and we see enormous potential in Volteras' platform to help fleets unlock the power of their data.\" Edenred Ventures Managing Partner, Norbert Furnion, added \"The potential applications of their technology\u2014both within Edenred and across the broader mobility and energy software ecosystem\u2014are expanding rapidly. Their focus on official data partnerships sets them apart, and positions them to become a foundational player in this evolving landscape.\"\"We're thrilled to have the support of world class investors who share our vision to transform the energy data ecosystem,\" saidPeter Wilson, CEO and co-founder of Volteras. \"This funding enables us to accelerate part of our mission to securely connect automakers, energy providers, and mobility platforms in unprecedented ways to enable a new generation of energy and mobility apps.\"Redefining the Energy EcosystemVolteras is revolutionizing the way data flows between electric vehicles (EVs), chargers and home batteries in the energy ecosystem, similar to how Plaid connected data between banks in the financial ecosystem.Starting with a transparent, partnership-based approach. The startup has integrated over 30 OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), and its partnerships include Ford, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen Group AG. The startup is working to create a world where every aspect of EV ownership- from purchase to charging to insurance- seamlessly integrates through a single data platform. A platform that ensures fast, stable, and secure data streaming. Businesses from fleet and charging management to virtual power plants, insurance providers and more, can grow revenue and improve operational efficiencies via Volteras' high-quality data streaming.\"Through our partnership with Volteras, more businesses in the energy and mobility sectors can access real-time, multi-brand vehicle data,\" said Alistair Colam, Northern Europe Sales at Mobilisights (Stellantis' data business unit). \"This unlocks new opportunities for fleet optimization, preventive maintenance, and smarter energy management\u2014empowering Volteras' customers to operate more efficiently and sustainably.\"Story ContinuesA Full Lifecycle Vision for Consumers and BusinessesVolteras' ultimate goal is to build the world's largest energy data platform, collaborating with automakers and energy leaders to deliver innovation and sustainability at scale. As this vision becomes a reality, consumers and businesses both win:Businesses: Volteras will help to unlock fleet optimization, preventive maintenance, and grid demand balancing with real-time data. Energy companies will be able to better balance grid demand by varying energy consumption and 'flattening the curve' in times of high demand.Consumers: Volteras enables usage-based insurance, smart charging solutions that pushes electricity back to the grid and times when electricity prices are lowest to intake charge, and battery health reports to provide transparency to the used EV market. Moreover, Volteras' API will connect an EV to a home energy management system allowing a consumer to optimize energy usage, check carbon footprints, and see if the electricity that is powering a battery, EV or home is renewable.Driving Innovation with Series A FundingWith the new funding, Volteras will:Expand its partnerships with automakers and energy device manufacturers globally;Grow its team of software engineers, data scientists, and energy product specialists and;Support new partners like Octopus Electric Vehicles and Hitachi ZeroCarbon in launching new EV services.Hitachi ZeroCarbon is relying on Volteras to launch a new charging management service that helps fleets go electric, by connecting the fleet without the need for hardware.Jim\u00a0Donaldson, Hitachi ZeroCarbon's Chief Technology Officer, explains the benefits of outsourcing high-quality energy data, \"Volteras has simplified the process of obtaining automaker data, enabling us to onboard new customer vehicles quickly, easily and at a low cost. This has allowed us to focus on our own innovations, and deliver the insight our customers need.\"Enterprise-Grade SecurityData protection is a top priority as clean energy businesses handle sensitive data like vehicle telematics, user login details and access commands like remote vehicle control. OEM-authorized integrations ensure that data is transmitted through secure, encrypted channels, which are protected from cybersecurity attacks.Providers that use unauthorized streaming methods extract data from third-party apps that don't have enterprise-grade security built in and can be easily exploited. This means high cybersecurity risks. If data is compromised, it can lead to heavy financial losses, operational disruptions, or even drivers being locked out of their vehicles.The data of Volteras customers is securely streamed from OEM servers and devices only. Customers' personally identifiable information is not shared\u2014Volteras only accesses data relating to the vehicle with the agreed consent from the owner.About VolterasFounded inLondon, Volteras is the premier data streaming platform for the energy ecosystem, connecting vehicles, chargers, and energy systems securely and efficiently. Through OEM-authorized data integrations, Volteras is setting new standards in how energy and mobility businesses operate.Contact:press@volteras.comCisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/volteras-raises-11-1-million-series-a-to-transform-energy-and-mobility-data-302468240.htmlSOURCE VolterasTermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore InfoRecommended Stories"

The goal, he said, is a 20-fold expansion over the coming months.\"While ride-hailing transformed mobility and e-commerce reshaped fashion, regular home services remained largely undigitised. With Snabbit, we're solving for trust, quality, and speed \u2014 all at the tap of a button,\" Agarwal said.Snabbit manages sourcing, training, and deployment of its workforce internally, with a backend that integrates digital identity verification through a partnership withIdfy. The startup's pricing model, which charges by the hour rather than by task, is meant to ensure consistency and accountability across service types.As of now, more than 600 professionals work through the platform\u2014a figure that Agarwal says is doubling every month. Many of these workers are women from informal job backgrounds who previously lacked formal work benefits.Snabbit\u2019s onboarding system includes Aadhaar-linked bank accounts and insurance, and some workers, Agarwal said, now earn up to Rs 40,000 a month through 12-hour shifts\u2014about twice what they might have made through traditional channels.Snabbit pitches itself not as a category-specific platform but as an everyday utility for urban homes needing timely, trustworthy assistance.\u201cSnabbit is transforming home services in India by bringing speed, structure, and trust to a sector that has largely operated informally until now. Aayush and the team are building a platform for urban households, a completely new category that will cater to the needs of millions,\u201d said Rahul Taneja, partner at Lightspeed.MumbaiFundingSubscribe to our Newsletter!Be the first to get exclusive offers and the latest newsSubscribe NowRelated ArticlesRead the Next Article"

Cleevo questions that model from the ground up,\" said Mayank Jain, Founder and CEO. \"This fundraise isn't just about capital\u2014it's validation of our mission to create smarter, safer, and more sustainable cleaning solutions.\"Cleevo's products are designed to reduce plastic waste, cut carbon emissions, and enable conscious consumption.

Already, the brand has served over 1.5 lakh customers across India, gaining traction on Zepto, Amazon, Flipkart, and its own D2C platform.\"Cleevo is proving that conscious cleaning doesn't need to be costly or inconvenient,\" said Dhruv Dhanraj Bahl, Managing Partner at Eternal Capital. \"They're re-engineering every aspect of the category\u2014format, logistics, and formulation\u2014to make sustainability the new default.\"With innovation at its core and sustainability in its DNA, Cleevo is redefining what clean means for the modern Indian household."

    "content": "ETMarkets.comIn personal finance, most people aren\u2019t looking for a long-term solution\u2014they\u2019re searching for a quick remedy. It\u2019s evident from the most commonly searched queries on the internet: \u201cWhich is the best mutual fund?\u201d, \u201cWhat are the top-performing mutual funds?\u201d, \u201cWhichSIPgives the best return?\u201d, or \u201cWhich calculator can help me pick the right fund?\u201d. These questions all reflect the same mindset\u2014how to get rich quickly. However, real wealth creation doesn\u2019t come from chasing the best product; it comes from adopting the right strategy and sticking to it for the long haul.It might sound unbelievable, but investing just \u20b9100 a month through aSystematic Investment Plan(SIP) can actually help you accumulate \u20b91 crore. The catch? You\u2019ll need to invest regularly & stay invested for 48 years. This is based on an assumed annualised return of 15%, which aligns with what Indian equity markets have historically delivered over the last 35 to 40 years. And given India\u2019s growth trajectory, there's little reason to doubt that similar returns can't be expected in the decades to come.But here\u2019s the real challenge: Can you stay committed to this small contribution, year after year, for almost half a century? Can you ignore the market noise, resist the temptation to redeem early, and maintain the discipline to invest through financial highs and lows? The problem isn't in the math\u2014it\u2019s in the mindset.Best MF to investLooking for the best mutual funds to invest? Here are our recommendations.ViewDetails\u00bbIf 48 years seems like too long a wait, you can always compress the journey by increasing your monthly SIP. For example, if you want to reach the \u20b91 crore goal in 35 years instead of 48, you\u2019d need to invest around \u20b9700 a month. That\u2019s less than what many of us spend on a single weekend outing. Want to get there even faster\u2014in 25 years? Just \u20b93,000 a month will do. These figures aren\u2019t out of reach for most individuals with a steady income, especially when you consider how seemingly small expenses add up over time.The magic that makes this strategy work is not some secret mutual fund or a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity\u2014it\u2019s the power of compounding. When you invest consistently over a long period, the returns you earn begin to generate their own returns. This compounding effect accelerates with time, making the early years of your investment journey the most crucial. The earlier you start, the more time your money has to grow exponentially.Live EventsUnfortunately, many potential investors get stuck at the starting line. They believe their contributions are too small to matter, or they wait for the \u201cperfect\u201d time or the \u201cbest\u201d fund. But the truth is, the best time to start investing was yesterday\u2014the second-best time is today. Starting small isn\u2019t a limitation\u2014it\u2019s a strategy. It builds habit, discipline, and momentum. Over time, you can always increase the amount based on your income and financial goals.What often derails investors is the noise. Market crashes, economic headlines, peer pressure, and endless advice on where to invest can cause confusion and panic. But successful investors are rarely the ones who time the market or constantly shift between schemes. They are the ones who stay consistent, stay invested, and stay patient.So, what\u2019s the takeaway here? Don\u2019t wait for the stars to align before you start your investment journey.

    "content": "StartUpsThe Rise and Fall of Builder.ai: What Led to Its CollapseBuilder.ai's rapid rise and recent struggles highlight the complex challenges of scaling a startup. Questions around cash flow, governance, and culture offer lessons for India\u2019s startup ecosystem.Shrikanth G25 May 2025 12:17 ISTFollow UsNew UpdateSome startups seem to be trapped in a pattern:Build. Scale. Bleed. Repeat.The latest collapse is\u00a0 Builder.ai, a company that was into building an AI-powered composable software platform enabling every business and entrepreneur to become digitally empowered.( As it says in its LinkedIn bio) The company has gone bankrupt. The reason: no cash left to burn.AdvertismentIn a LinkedIn post recently, the company announced: \u201cToday, Engineer.ai Corporation, known as Builder.ai, will be entering into insolvency proceedings and will appoint an administrator to manage the company\u2019s affairs. Despite the tireless efforts of our current team and exploring every possible option, the business has been unable to recover from historic challenges and past decisions that placed significant strain on its financial position.\u201d\u201cOur immediate priority is to support our employees, customers, and partners through this difficult time. We will work closely with the appointed administrators to ensure an orderly process and to explore all available options for parts of the business, where possible. We want to extend our sincere gratitude to our employees for their commitment and hard work, to our customers for their loyalty, and to our partners and suppliers for their support over the years.\u201dTrust, Transparency and Other Systemic IssuesAdvertismentA company that\u2019s valued at more than $1bn, backed by leading names like Microsoft and Qatar\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund and others, went through successful funding rounds, a carefully crafted brand identity with good media eyeballs \u2013 yet it succumbed unceremoniously.Seeded in 2016 by Sachin Dev Duggal and Saurabh Dhoot, Builder.ai vowed to democratize app development, making it accessible to individuals and businesses without technical expertise. In 2016, AI was still a domain of academia, and this sounded like a cocktail of low-code-no-code titrated with AI. For instance, Builder.ai\u2019s platform leveraged AI to streamline the software creation process, and this futuristic vision acted as a funding magnet, and by 2023, it had secured around $450+ million in funding and was valued at more than $1 billion.Lessons for the Indian Startup EcosystemAdvertismentBuilder.ai's rise and fall serve as a cautionary tale for the Indian startup community. Even though the company was based in the UK, its founders were of Indian origin and a significant part of the development teams were based in India. What this bankruptcy reveals is the importance of transparency\u00a0 and robust financial oversight. While innovation and ambition are vital, they must be balanced with accountability, integrity, and fair trade practices.For investors, it frontlines the importance of 360-degree due diligence.\u00a0 For entrepreneurs, it serves as an apt reminder that sustainable success is built not just on groundbreaking ideas but also on trust and transparency. And for the estimated 600+ odd employees of the company, it\u2019s a sad event.The final takeaway:The story of Builder.ai remains a poignant example of how even the most promising ventures can falter due to numerous operational variables.AdvertismentAlso Read:Key Financial Principles Every Startup Founder Should KnowHow to Build a Startup: What Makes or Breaks ItAdvertismentThe Hidden Costs of Hustle Culture: A Tech Founder\u2019s Cautionary TaleChronic Survivors of the Digital Age: The Syndrome of Scaling Without ProfitsAdvertismentstartupsSubscribe to our Newsletter!Be the first to get exclusive offers and the latest newsSubscribe NowRelated ArticlesRead the Next Article"

This disparity ignited her mission to co-found Varaha in 2022, leveraging carbon markets and climate-smart agriculture to transform sustainability into economic opportunity for smallholder farmers.\"Varaha addresses the pressing issues of climate change and food security by reducing agricultural emissions and improving soil health through nature-based solutions,\"said Ankita Garg, Co-founder and COO at Varaha. \"With the voluntary carbon market projected to exceed USD 100 billion by 2030, Varaha's target market across its operating geographies is estimated at USD 60 billion, offering significant growth potential.\"Early-stage investors Omnivore and Better Capital were among the first to back Varaha's mission, supporting its seed round. \"Their belief in our vision set the foundation for tackling climate change and food security issues,\" shared Ankita.Since its inception, Varaha has raised USD 13 million in funding from prominent investors such as RTP Global, Orios Venture Partners, Norinchukin Bank, Theia Ventures, Octave Wellbeing Economy Fund, and AgFunder. This financial backing has accelerated Varaha's expansion across India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Kenya. Today, the startup claims to have onboarded over 100,000 farmers covering one million acres, sequestering over two million tons of carbon.\"Being a female entrepreneur was just one challenge\u2014navigating carbon markets meant overcoming skepticism, building scalable MRV systems, and ensuring scientific rigor while staying farmer-friendly,\" Ankita explained. Her background in biotechnology and corporate experience helped bridge the gap between science, execution, and farmer realities.Despite achieving milestones like securing Series A funding and partnering with Google, challenges remain. \"Registry delays that slow credit issuance, affecting farmer payouts and project timelines, continue to be a hurdle,\" Ankita stated.Looking ahead, Varaha plans to expand its full-stack sustainable agriculture ecosystem, leveraging partnerships, IoT, and satellite technology. With access to over 10 million farmers and 20 million hectares through 100+ partners, it aims to scale its impact globally.Varaha also champions diversity, with 24% of its workforce being women and over 7,000 women empowered through its projects. Financially, the startup has seen exponential growth, with revenues reaching INR 21 crore in FY 2024-25, up from INR 5.8 crore in FY 2023-24 and INR 52 lakh in FY 2022-23.Under Ankita's leadership, Varaha is revolutionising climate-smart agriculture, making sustainability a viable economic pathway for farmers worldwide.Facts:Founded:2022Team:158 employees (125 male)Total funding:USD 13 Mn"

So, we launched in Bangalore and expanded into several different micro markets in Mumbai. We actually saw even faster growth there\u2014both in terms of scaling the business and acquiring customers. Once we saw that kind of traction, it made sense to prepare for a much faster acceleration in scaling these micro markets. That\u2019s why we went out and raised more capital,\" Founder Aayush Agarwal toldYourStory.Since its launch in March 2024, the platform is active across 10 micro-markets. With its latest capital infusion, it plans to launch in over 200 micro markets over the next nine months. It also plans to invest aggressively in building a team to support its expansion ambitions.The space has seen renewed interest, withUrban Companylaunching its Rs 1,900 crore IPO last month.

We\u2019re accelerating a new standard for delivery: one that\u2019s efficient, low-impact, and accessible to every logistics player in Europe.\u201dFounded in 2019, Bloq.it is a smart locker company, providing end-to-end services comprising hardware, the Bloq.OS software ecosystem, and operational support, for logistics, e-commerce, and retail businesses.Bloq.it\u2019s lockers and systems are designed to be compatible for integration with any logistics player, as well as scalable and customisable for different countries, locations, and product types.Partners include Vinted Go, the logistics arm of online marketplace Vinted and logistics multinationals DHL eCommerce and GLS.In 2024, Bloq.it reportedly achieved 100% YoY revenue growth and expanded its network adding over 5,000 new lockers \u2013 a 290% year-on-year increase. 2024 also marked the launch of NEXT, the company\u2019s autonomous locker designed to operate anywhere, even in off-grid locations and without the need for additional power sources.\u201cBloq.it is at the core of the transition to out-of-home delivery all across Europe\u2014despite our growth so far, there\u2019s a clear feeling that we\u2019re just getting started,\u201d addedJo\u00e3o Lopes, COO & CRO of Bloq.it.Bloq.it believes that e-commerce now drives the postal space. Although mail volume has been in active decline for years, parcel volume continues to increase.A 2024 McKinsey reportfound that consumer priorities have changed in tandem with this increase in parcel volume\u2014reliability and convenience now take precedence over speed.Meanwhile, the uptick in C2B2C sales through vintage and secondhand markets like Vinted and Etsy have seen a corresponding rise in consumers choosing out-of-home (OOH) delivery options. A new convenience-minded logistics and delivery market will require seamless OOH-oriented solutions.With over 50 million shipments processed through its systems every year, Bloq.it aims to be the driving force behind this paradigm shift. Over the last four years, Bloq.it has achieved a 73,083% accumulated revenue growth since 2021.Bloq.it argues that home delivery alone isn\u2019t a viable solution for themore than 19 billion parcelsdelivered in Europe last year, a number that\u2019s expected to rise to 30 billion by 2028-2029, indicating a critical gap in the market for scalable, secure, and convenient OOH delivery infrastructure \u2013 according to the company.Expansion into additional cities and hiring across Europe is already underway.TagsBloq.itBloq.OSdeliveryDHLetsyGLSJo\u00e3o LopesLisbonMiha JagodicParcelSeries BSmart LockerVinted GoShareFacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedinPrevious article\u201cNot chasing Crypto hype\u201d \u2013 London-based Velocity raises \u20ac8.8 million for financial infrastructure platformDavid Cendon GarciaDavid is the news editor at EU Startups.

The company currently runs 137 stores and plans to add 40\u201350 outlets annually.Founder and managing director Sudhanshu Agarwal said that a key priority is scaling profitably while testing new store formats in peri-urban regions of Delhi and Gurugram.Investcorp's full exitAdvertismentBahrain-based Investcorp, which had acquired IDFC Alternatives' private equity assets in 2019, has made a full exit in this round, reportedly generating a fourfold return on its six-year-old investment. India SME Investments, another early backer, has sold half its stake. As a result, TPG NewQuest has emerged as the largest institutional investor in Citykart, followed by A91 Partners and India SME.Citykart\u2019s topline has grown by 70% over the past two years and is projected to cross Rs 1,300 crore in revenue in FY26, up from over Rs 900 crore in FY25.Agarwal toldthe Economic Timesthat the company has remained profitable for five consecutive years. Despite the growth, Citykart\u2019s valuation multiple of 1.5 times its FY25 revenue remains modest compared to listed peers. For instance, VMart trades at 2x revenue, while Vishal Mega Mart \u2014 with a more diversified product mix including groceries \u2014 commands a valuation of 5.4x.Agarwal said Citykart could unlock higher valuations post an IPO but ruled out immediate plans to go public. \u201cIPO is on the cards but, for us, it\u2019s not a milestone that we want to achieve immediately,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cWe want to double down on our revenue growth and profitability before thinking about an IPO.\u201dThe company is focusing on fashion for Bharat through a store-first strategy built around in-house brands like Athiya, Nimes, Fumee, and Remise. Agarwal believes that in small-town India, organised value retail is rapidly displacing the unorganised sector as incomes rise.\u201cWith a 10% increase in income levels, the disposable income rises by 50%,\u201d he said, underlining the opportunity for affordable fashion.He added that the new investors are expected to benefit either through sustained business growth or future public market listing.\u201cCitykart has demonstrated an exceptional ability to scale profitably in one of the most challenging and underserved segments of Indian retail. Their deep customer understanding, disciplined execution, and strong leadership team make them well-positioned to drive value fashion retail across India. We are excited to partner with them in this next phase of growth,\u201d said Bharati Agarwal of TPG NewQuest.Citykart\u2019s latest round marks one of the largest private equity infusions in India\u2019s value retail space, as firms double down on domestic consumption stories outside the metros.

The Series B funding round was led by Forerunner Ventures and FPV Ventures.Monarch plans to deliver a mobile app designed to help users monitor their expenses, investments, and financial goals. This market was previously dominated by Mint, a personal finance company that was acquired by Intuit in 2009. After years of stagnation, Intuit decided to shut down Mint in early 2024.The company\u2019s funding round comes at a time when interest in consumer-focused fintech\u2019s in the US has diminished. Monarch is among the few firms to secure significant Series B funding; other notable recent examples include Felix, a money remittance service targeting Latino immigrants.Fintech companies secure USD 1.9 billion in venture capital fundingIn the first quarter, fintech companies raised USD 1.9 billion in venture funding, reflecting a 38% decline from the previous quarter. This trend indicates growing investor caution toward direct-to-consumer models, as highlighted in a recent PitchBook report. According to PitchBook, approximately three-quarters of all the venture capital raised during this quarter was allocated to companies in the enterprise fintech sector.Representatives from Monarch noted that managing finances remains a significant challenge in consumer technology. The approach taken by American families to handle their finances has changed little since the late 1990s; the primary difference is that they now use their phones instead of visiting a bank. Following Intuit's announcement of Mint's closure, Monarch, which was established in 2018, experienced a 20-fold increase in its subscriber base in 2024, as users began looking for alternatives.Source:Link"

Data engineers lack visibility to prevent disruptions when making changes.3.) Governance teams struggle to track sensitive data access.For AI systems, this context gap is even more critical. So AI models need to know when new data is available for refreshing predictions, which enterprise data is trustworthy, and how to analyze schema changes automatically. DataHub addresses this challenge by providing a real-time metadata platform that brings order to data and AI chaos, enabling machines to interact with an organization\u2019s data assets with complete context awareness.What the funding will be used for:DataHub will use the new capital to:1.)

    "content": "Otipy,a community group-buying startup based in Delhi-NCR that linked consumers with fresh farm produce and everyday essentials, ceased operations following an unsuccessful attempt to close a vital $10 million funding round.According to media reports, the collapse was set in motion when India\u2019s Hero family office unexpectedly pulled out from the funding at the last minute, plunging the startup into a sudden cash crunch, leaving around 300 employees in the lurch.While the shutdown underscores the growing funding squeeze facing startups, it has also sparked mounting concerns over unpaid dues and stuck wallet balances.Otipy co-founder and CEO Varun Khurana is believed to have addressed employees in a town hall held on May 18, wherein he urged them to seek alternative opportunities, citing the company\u2019s inability to sustain operations.According to a report by Inc42, the startup has not paid employee salaries for the past six weeks and is now aiming to settle outstanding dues, with Khurana reportedly working to liquidate company assets to meet obligations.Otipy, the consumer-facing brand of parent company Crofarm Agriproducts, had earned a reputation as a trailblazer in the farm-to-table supply chain space.The startup leveraged a network of community resellers to facilitate group buying, offering fresh produce at affordable prices by optimising the logistics between farmers and urban consumers.Otipy grabbed attention in 2022 when it raised $32 million in a Series B round led by private equity firm WestBridge Capital. The round also drew continued support from existing backers, including SIG and Omidyar Network India.This capital infusion followed a $10.2 million funding round just six months earlier. The round was joined by SIG, Omidyar Network India, IPV (Inflection Point Ventures), and Pravega Ventures.A wave of startups backed by prominent investors is, of late, struggling to secure new funding amidst a turbulent macroeconomic landscape. These include names such as 10Club, backed by consumer-focused VC firmFireside Ventures.The e-commerce marketplace aggregator, which once raised one of India\u2019s largest seed rounds, filed for insolvency earlier this month after struggling to establish a sustainable business model.Casualties are \u201croutine events\u201d in the startup ecosystem, said Pranav Pai, Founding Partner at 3one4 Capital, highlighting that \u201cthey happen globally\u201d.\u201cMost venture-backed companies do not succeed, and even larger startups regularly falter across sectors and regions. Innovation is a brutal and competitive industry, and the destruction of non-competitive businesses will continue to occur,\u201d he said.The real concern, however, emerges when these struggles expose deeper issues around governance, transparency, and accountability within segments of the startup ecosystem. This is evident in recent cases such as Builder.ai, the no-code software development startup, as well as Gensol Engineering, highlighting systemic challenges that go beyond just market competition.Just last month, EV ride-hailing platformBluSmarthalted cab bookings in India after the country\u2019s capital markets regulator issued an interim order alleging financial misconduct at the publicly-listedGensol Engineering, leaving commuters in a fix. Gensol and BluSmart share common promoters, and the former also financed and leased electric vehicles to BluSmart.The inconvenience was compounded as many users loaded funds into BluSmart\u2019s in-app \u2018Blu\u2019 wallets. That left them stranded without access to their prepaid balance. \u201cWe are not even able to refund the money customers deposited in the Blu wallet as all our [company\u2019s] accounts are empty,\u201d an internal source at that time had told DealStreetAsia.\u201cWhile write-offs due to failed business models despite great teams working on it are common in the investing world, those due to governance oversight are being baulked at by LPs and point to diligence failures,\u201d said Anup Jain, founder partner at BlueGreen Ventures.There are two critical points of failure, he explained. The first is pre-investment diligence, where the fundamental question arises:if the business model was flawed, why did the investment go through? The second is post-investment diligence, where issues such as fund siphoning, founder self-gratification, or fraudulent misrepresentation come to light.While Builder.ai is backed by Jungle Ventures and the Qatar Investment Authority, BluSmart, too, has a roster of prominent investors. These include names such asresponsAbility,MS Dhoni Family Office,BP Ventures, Survam Partners, Mayfield India Fund, 9Unicorns (now 100Unicorns), JITO Angel Network, Green Frontier Capital, Stride Ventures, Alteria Capital,BlackSoil, and Ka Innovations LLP, the family office of Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone."

    "content": "An article fromDeep DiveHow restaurant chains are updating their marketing menus in tough economyMarketers at QSR and fast casual brands are taking big swings with creative campaigns, evolving loyalty strategies and technology investments.Published May 28, 2025Chris KellySenior ReporterpostsharepostprintemaillicenseMcDonald's has been a canary in the coal mine for the restaurant industry's struggles but has worked to boost sales with creative campaigns and its loyalty program.Justin Sullivan via Getty ImagesMajor restaurant brands frequently face stiff competition and low margins, a business reality that is even tougher to navigate during periods of consumer uncertainty. These concerns have been prevalent so far in 2025, as the Trump administration\u2019s fluctuating tariff plans have kept the economy on edge.Amidst the turmoil, a number of these businesses are leaning on their marketing organizations to buoy sales, including with big-swing creative campaigns, evolving loyalty strategies and investing in digital technology.\u201cWith the rise in uncertainty and the possibility of rising prices because of tariffs, a lot of the chains are shifting the marketing strategy to be focused more on nostalgia or innovation, and moving away from price point,\u201d said R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at location analytics platform Placer.ai.While earnings reports for most quick-service and fast-casual restaurants have shown few bright spots, a recent analysis by Marketing Dive reveals several trends around how marketers are doing their part to maintain positive relationships with consumers.Bets on cultureQSR leader McDonald\u2019s has been a red-and-yellow canary in the coal mine for the restaurant industry\u2019s struggles, withU.S. same-store sales dropping 3.6% in Q1 2025, a stark contrast from the 12.6% increase notched in Q1 2023 and 2.5% in Q1 2024.\u201cWe entered 2025 knowing that it would be a challenging time for the QSR industry due to macroeconomic uncertainty and pressures weighing on the consumer,\u201d CEO Chris Kempczinskisaid on McDonald\u2019s most recent earnings call. \u201cWe\u2019re not immune to the volatility in the industry or the pressures that our consumers are facing.\u201dMcDonald\u2019s continues to try to put its brand at the center of culture and replicate the success of its Famous Orders platform and activations like theviral Grimace birthdaycampaign of 2023. The chain this yeartapped John Cenato promote its value menu and unveiled aPok\u00e9mon Happy Meal, but its biggest win could end up being a partnership with \u201cA Minecraft Movie.\u201d Launched in March,the campaign around the record-breaking video game adaptationwas the chain\u2019s largest global campaign yet and rolled out in more than 100 markets.\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged by the consumer response to the \u2018Minecraft\u2019 movie campaign and by our overall performance in April, which illustrates the benefit of our value platforms working in conjunction with full-margin promotions and outstanding marketing execution,\u201d Kempczinski said on the Q1 earnings call.McDonald\u2019s national linear TV ad spend was estimated to be $39.6 million in Q1, up nearly 75% year over year, with an emphasis on savings-focused ads and itspartnership with WNBA star Angel Reese, per iSpot data shared with Marketing Dive. The chain saw a 19.5% lift in web traffic driven by linear TV advertising, surpassing other burger brands in arecent study by TV outcomes measurement company EDO. The findings suggest that McDonald\u2019s could see further gains by optimizing its TV ad spend, shifting away from underperforming dayparts like primetime towards the early morning.\u201cQSR brands are seeing strong consumer response to value meal deal ads during this period of budget tightening, where every dollar \u2014 both for consumers and advertisers \u2014 must work harder,\u201d said Laura Grover, senior vice president and head of client solutions at EDO, in a statement. \u201cAs marketers navigate this uncertain landscape, impression quality becomes the key to driving smarter allocation decisions and ensuring stronger returns within a brand\u2019s existing media footprint.\u201dTransformation through marketingWhile McDonald\u2019s works to hitch its brand to pop culture, Starbucks is trying to reassert its brand identity as part of a turnaround plan that includessignificant marketing investments. The cafe chain in Q1 saw U.S. comparable store sales decline 2%, with a 4% decline in comparable transactions partially offset by a 3% increase in average order cost.Launched around the Super Bowl, \u201cHello Again\u201d and \u201cStarbucks Monday\u201d generated record-breaking customer engagement and drove the chain\u2019s second-highest Monday gross sales day ever, CEO Brian Niccol said on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call. The percentage of customers ranking Starbucks as their first choice is the highest it's been in two years, and TikTok engagement has increased by nearly three times quarter-over-quarter, the executive said.\u201cWe saw stabilization in our non-Starbucks Rewards member traffic, indicating our broad-based marketing campaign to reintroduce Starbucks to the world is resonating with our customers,\u201d Niccol said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to continue to just get better from here as it relates to the marketing side of the business.\u201dLike Starbucks, Papa Johns is also undertaking a transformation strategy that includes amplifying marketing messages as a key priority. To that end,the pizza chain in March launched \u201cMeet the Makers,\u201d the first creative work under CMO Jenna Bromberg, who joined in November. The campaign delivered early positive results, helping to increase customer awareness and consideration among QSRs, according to CEO Todd Penegor. Papa Johns\u2019 North America comparable sales were down 3% year over year in Q1.Informed by consumer insights, the chain plans to evolve the campaign to focus on its use of simple, fresh ingredients. Papa Johns has also relied on incremental media investments to both reinforce the brand and improve transactions.\u201cAs we amplify our marketing message, we are investing to win share of voice at both the national and regional levels, drive transactions, support continued testing of value propositions, and increase our agility,\u201d Penegor said on the earnings call.Evolving loyaltyAcross the restaurant landscape, marketers are working to fine-tune and evolve their loyalty platforms and rewards programs to better meet the needs of cost-conscious consumers. McDonald\u2019s continues to see strong systemwide sales from loyalty members, notching $31 billion for the trailing 12-month period as it looks to secure $45 billion a year by 2027 in this area. While the loyalty sales are encouraging, McDonald is looking to strike a balance between its everyday value menu and limited-time digital offers.\u201cUntil you get to a point where the usage of the app is the majority of your traffic, relying on that as the primary source of value, it just doesn\u2019t work because you\u2019re not reaching the majority of your consumers,\u201d Kempczinski said on the earnings call. \u201cFor that reason, having a broad platform like we have, McValue, that\u2019s available to everybody\u2026 it\u2019s an imperative that you have that, which is why we\u2019ve spent the time and energy getting that launched properly.\u201dCava \u2014 one of thebig winners of fast casual chainsin Q1 with 10.8% year-over-year growth \u2014 has also made its loyalty program a focus. The purveyor of Mediterranean fare saw sales through the program increase 340 basis points as a percentage of total revenuesince an October relaunch. Total membership in the program is approaching 8 million members, with more than 50,000 new registrations per week. The results speak to the chain\u2019s new strategy around loyalty.\u201cThe original goal was moving from a more transaction-based \u2018spend X, get Y\u2019 to a \u2018earn and bank points\u2019 model that would drive greater engagement and participation in the program, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d CEO Brett Schulman said on an earnings call. \u201cSo, you looked at our lower frequency or mid-tier frequency users, and we lowered the entry reward hurdle, and that has gotten those users more engaged.\u201dFor Cava, bringing guests into its first-party ecosystem increases opportunities for personalization and fosters a test-and-learn environment for engagement. The chain plans to roll out the second phase of its loyalty program, introducing a tiered structure that adds increased benefits and rewards based on visit frequency, per the earnings call.\"The level of insights we have with our guests today plays a big role in informing the executional elements of a loyalty program.\"Michael SkipworthCEO, WingstopLike competitor and loyalty innovator Domino\u2019s before it, Papa Johns in November lowered the redemption threshold of Papa Rewards, a change that helped draw about 1 million more loyalty members into the loyalty program in Q1, for a total of more than 37 million. While the change also caused a slight overall decrease in the size of orders, it drove growth among medium- and high-frequency loyalty consumers and caused faster repeat purchases.As brands with mature loyalty programs tweak their offerings, new entrants continue to emerge. Wingstop will pilot a loyalty program in Q4, with plans for a system-wide launch in 2026. The loyalty program will draw on insights and membership from the 50 million-strong database of its MyWingstop digital ordering platform and offer Gen Z and millennial consumers experiential engagement opportunities.\u201cWe believe our loyalty program will be distinctive in the industry because we\u2019re not taking the typical transactional approach within our design.

SouthernMay 26, 2025\u22c55 min  readSEJ STAFFMatt G. SouthernSenior News Writer atSearch Engine JournalBioFollow46SHARES906READSGoogle\u2019s latest AI tools promise to manage campaigns automatically. But advertisers are asking whether these new features give up too much human control.At Google Marketing Live, the companyshowcasedthree new AI agents. These tools can handle everything from creating campaigns to managing tasks across multiple platforms.However, the announcement raised questions from attendees about accountability and transparency.The reaction highlights growing tension in the industry. Platforms want more automation, while marketers worry about losing control of their accounts.What Google Introduced1. Google Ads Agentic ExpertThis system makes changes to your campaigns without first asking for permission. It can:Create multiple ad groups with matching creative assetsAdd keywords and implement creative suggestionsFix policy issues and submit appealsGenerate reports and answer campaign questions2. Google Analytics Data ExpertThis tool finds insights and trends automatically. It also makes data exploration easier through simple visuals.The goal is to help marketers spot performance patterns without deep Analytics knowledge.3. Marketing Advisor Chrome ExtensionThis browser extension launches later this year. It manages tasks across multiple platforms, including:Automated tagging and tag installationSeasonal trend analysisProblem diagnosis across different sitesMarketing Advisor works across Google properties like Google Ads and Analytics. It also works on external websites and content management systems.Here\u2019s a promotional video demonstrating these tools\u2019 capabilities:Where Advertisers Push BackDuring a press session led by Melissa Hsieh Nikolic, Director of Product Management for YouTube Ads, and Pallavi Naresh, Director of Product Management for Google Ads, executives addressed concerns from industry professionals.Control and Change Tracking IssuesAdvertisers asked how AI-made changes would appear in Google Ads\u2019 change history, but executives couldn\u2019t give clear answers.Naresh responded:\u201cThat\u2019s a great question. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll show up with your username or like you and the agent\u2019s username.\u201dThis uncertainty worries agencies and brands. They need detailed records of campaign changes for client reports and internal approvals.One attendee directly questioned the automation direction, stating:\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the \u2018googlification\u2019 of the Google help desk. Getting to a human is hard. This seems like it\u2019s going down the path of replacing that.\u201dGoogle reps promised human support would stay available, responding:\u201cThat\u2019s not the intention. You will still be able to access support in the ways you can today.\u201dTransparency and Content Labeling GapsThe new AI creative tools raised questions about content authenticity.Google introduced image-to-video creation and \u201coutpainting\u201d technology. Outpainting expands video content for different screen sizes. However, Google\u2019s approach to AI content labeling differs from other platforms.Hsieh Nikolic explained:\u201cAll of our images are watermarked with metadata and SynthID so generated content can be identified. At this time, we\u2019re not labeling ads with any sort of identification.\u201dThis approach is different from other platforms that use visible AI content labels.Performance Claims & Industry ContextGoogle shared performance data for its AI-enhanced tools. Products with AI-generated images saw a \u201cremarkable 20% increase on return on ad spend\u201d compared to standard listings.The company also said \u201cadvertiser adoption of Google AI for generating creative increased by 2500%\u201d in the past year. But this growth comes with the control concerns mentioned above.Google revealed it\u2019s \u201cactively working on a generative creative API.\u201d This could impact third-party tools and agency workflows.The timing makes sense given industry pressures. Google says marketers spend \u201c10 hours or more every week creating visual content.\u201d These tools directly address that pain point.What This Means for Digital MarketingThe three-agent system is Google\u2019s biggest push into hands-off advertising management yet. It moves beyond creative help to full campaign control.Digital marketing has always been about precise budget and targeting control. This shift toward AI decision-making changes how advertisers and platforms work together.The pushback from advertisers suggests more resistance than Google expected. This is especially true around accountability and transparency, which agencies and brands need for client relationships.The Marketing Advisor Chrome extension is particularly ambitious. It extends Google\u2019s reach beyond its platforms into general marketing workflow management, which could reshape how digital marketing teams work across the industry.What Marketers Should DoSet Up AI Change ProtocolsAs these features roll out, advertisers should:Create clear rules for AI-driven campaign changesMake sure approval processes can handle automated changesDevelop documentation requirements for AI modificationsDemand Clear TrackingThe change history question is still unresolved. It\u2019s critical for agencies and brands that need detailed campaign records. Marketers should:Ask for specific details about change tracking before using agentic featuresCreate backup documentation processes for AI modificationsClarify how automated changes will show in client reportsPrepare for API ChangesGoogle is developing a generative creative API. Marketing teams should think about how this might impact:Existing third-party tool connectionsAgency workflow automationCustom reporting systemsClosing ThoughtsGoogle\u2019s three-agent system shows the company\u2019s confidence in AI-driven advertising management. It builds on the success of over 500,000 advertisers using conversational AI features.However, industry practitioners\u2019 concerns highlight real challenges around control, transparency, and technical readiness. As these tools become standard practice, these issues need solutions.CategoryNewsDigital Advertising"
